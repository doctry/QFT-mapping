# Configurations in the config file
- `algo`: If this configuration is a number $n$, the program maps a QFT of $n$ qubits consisting of only two-qubit gates. If this configuration is a string, then the configuration should be the path to the `.qasm` file.
- `cycle`: The cycle number of different gates.
    - `SINGLE_CYCLE`: The cycle number of single-qubit gates.
    - `SWAP_CYCLE`: The cycle number of swap gates.
    - `CX_CYCLE`: The cycle number of cnot gates.
- `device`: The path to the device `.txt` file.
- `output`: The path to the output `.json` file.
- `mapper`: The configurations about the mapper.
    - `placer`:  
        - `sa`: Simulated annealing on initial placement. 
        - `dfs`: The order of doing dfs from the qubit 0.
        - `static`: The same as IBM's assignment. 
        - `random`: Randomly placed.
    - `scheduler`: 
        - `onion`: Scheduling layer by layer.
        - `static`: Choosing the oldest item in the waitlist.
        - `greedy`: Choosing the best item in the waitlist.
        - `dora`: 
        - `old`: The gates are assigned according to the indices of the gates.
        - `random`: Randomly choose an item in the waitlist.
    - `router`: 
        - `duostra`: Find the lowest time cost in every step.
        - `apsp`: Find the shortest path(with lowest number of swaps) in every step.
    - `orientation`:
        - `true`: Qubits with small logical indices swapped first.
        - `false`: Default.
    - `cost`:
        - `start`: The cost of a gate is the start time.
        - `end`: The cost of a gate is the end time.
    - `greedy_conf`: The configurations of greedy scheduler.
        - `candidates`: The number of items considered in the waitlist. If the number is less than 1, all the items in the waitlist are considered.
        - `apsp_coef`: The coeffecient dividing apsp cost. Must be integer.
        - `avail`: The available time cost.
            - `min`: The cost of available time is the smaller of the two.
            - `max`: The cost of available time is the greater of the two.
        - `cost`: 
            - `min`: The min_element will be chosen from the waitlist.
            - `max`: The max_element will be chosen from the waitlist.
        - `layer_from_first`:
            - `true`: The layer of onion scheduler is calculated from the first.
            - `false`: The layer of onion scheduler is calculated from the last.
- `IBM_Gate`:
    - `true`:
    - `false`:
- `stdio`:
    - `true`: Output the result.
    - `false`: Not to output the result.
- `dump`:
    - `true`: Dump the result.
    - `false`: Not to dump the result.
